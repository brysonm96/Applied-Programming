# Overview

R Language is used for statistical computing. R language teaches data incoporation/managing skills.

I created two programs. One creates a grocery list and allows the user to add items to it using a list.
The second incorporates a CSV data file and allows th user to access information about grocery products.

My purpose in creating this software is to demonstrate new powerful software developing principles.
