# Overview

The web app that I developed is a poll that is meant to gather and store information for statistical use. To start the test server on my computer I use the terminal to run the 'python manage.py runserver' command (terminal path must be in the same directory that the manage.py file resides).  To see the first page of my app, simply paste the address that is shown after running the runserver command, followed by /polls/1. It should look like this: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1"

My purpose in creating this software is to demonstrate new powerful software developing principles.

# Web Pages

My app runs three seperate web pages. The question page with the question and multiple choices for answers, the results page that displays the stored values for each answer's corresponding votes, and the admin page that is only accesible by the specified admin which is used for modifying. The questions and each answer were dynamically created using python shell scripts through the command prompt on my computer, and the vote results are dynamically created using a python script I edited in VS Code.

# Development Environment

This program was developed in Visual Studio Code and Django web framework.

This program was written in the python and HTML language.

# Future Work

Things to fix, improve, and add in the future
* Plan for accidents, more time may be needed
* Add more character to my web pages
* Get better at making comments

# Note
I had to do some setting up using my computer's command prompt. Some scripts may not run correctly or may be hard to test without proper setup.
