# Overview

By practicing the use of classes and objects I am furthering my skills as a software developer.

The game I created is a simple test of survival,  see how long you can avoid the obstacles placed in front of you to collect the highest score.

My purpose in creating this software is to demonstrate new powerful software developing principles.
