# Overview

By practicing the use of functions in JavaScript, I am furthering my skills as a software developer.

The program I created provides three different activites that involve numbers. It is a fun interactive way to visualize the use of various functions in JavaScript.

My purpose in creating this software is to demonstrate new powerful software developing principles.
