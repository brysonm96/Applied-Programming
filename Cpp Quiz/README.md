# Overview

By implementing various coding principles in my program, I am furthering my skills as a software developer.

The program I created is a tool that can be used for fun, or even to help you study. It is a simple quiz that provides 10 questions and a score based on how many answers you got correct.

My purpose in creating this software is to demonstrate new powerful software developing principles.
