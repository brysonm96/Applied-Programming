# Overview

The mobile apps I created are meant to receive input from the user, and return a random item. The dice app works like an actual board game die, and returns a random
number between 1-6. The Dinner app selects a random dish from a list of foods to give the user an idea of what to have for dinner.

My purpose in creating this software is to demonstrate new powerful software developing principles.
